# TASK-002A: Configurable Spatial Substrates - Planning Status

**Status:** ✅ PLANNING COMPLETE - READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION
**Date:** 2025-11-04
**Process:** Research → Plan → Review → Iterate → Final

---

## Planning Process Summary

Successfully executed a staged planning process for TASK-002A using three specialized subagents with one iteration cycle:

### 1. Research Subagent (COMPLETED ✅)

- **Task:** Comprehensive investigation of spatial substrate hardcoding
- **Findings:**
  - Position tensors always `[num_agents, 2]` hardcoded
  - Manhattan distance in 4 locations (lines ~274, ~462, ~541 in vectorized_env.py)
  - Observation dim depends on `grid_size²` (hardcoded calculation)
  - ~15 core files with spatial assumptions
  - Complete file inventory with line numbers
  - Feasibility analysis for alternative topologies (3D, hex, graph, aspatial)
- **Output:** `docs/research/2025-11-04-spatial-substrates-research.md`

### 2. Planning Subagent (COMPLETED ✅)

- **Task:** Develop detailed, bite-sized implementation plan
- **First Attempt:** Created comprehensive plan with 8 phases, 40+ tasks (15-22 hours)
  - **USER FEEDBACK:** "You've expanded the scope - there are already planned tasks for DTOs and schemas"
  - **Issue:** Included Pydantic schema validation (belongs in TASK-001)
- **Second Attempt:** Simplified plan focusing on "exposing the actual system"
  - **Output:** `docs/plans/2025-11-04-spatial-substrates-simple.md`
  - **Structure:**
    - Phase 1: Substrate Abstraction Layer (3 tasks)
    - Phase 2: Environment Integration (4 tasks)
    - Phase 3: Simple Config Loading (2 tasks)
    - Phase 4: Verification (1 task)
  - **Methodology:** TDD throughout (test first, implement, verify, commit)
  - **Estimated Effort:** 6-8 hours (down from 15-22)

### 3. Review Subagent (COMPLETED ✅)

- **Task:** Identify inconsistencies, gaps, and technical concerns
- **Findings:** Plan is **production-ready** with minor revisions needed
- **Scope Compliance:** Grade A - ZERO Pydantic mentions, proper deferrals
- **Research Coverage:** Grade A- - Addresses all core hardcoded references
- **Technical Soundness:** Grade B+ - Correct approach with 3 clarifications needed
- **High-Priority Issues Found:**
  1. ⚠️ Clarify encode_positions() behavior (needs to match ObservationBuilder)
  2. ⚠️ Document RecurrentSpatialQNetwork limitation (LSTM hardcoded to 2D)
  3. ⚠️ Add get_valid_spawn_positions() method to abstract class
- **Recommendation:** APPROVE WITH MINOR REVISIONS

### 4. Revision Cycle (COMPLETED ✅)

- **Task:** Address 3 high-priority issues from review
- **Changes Made:**
  1. ✅ Verified encode_positions() matches current ObservationBuilder (lines 127-137)
     - Added clarifying comments in implementation
     - Grid values: 0=empty, 1=affordance OR agent, 2=agent ON affordance
  2. ✅ Added get_valid_spawn_positions() to abstract interface
     - Grid2D: Returns all `[(x, y)]` grid cells
     - Aspatial: Returns single `[()]` aspatial position
     - Updates abstract method count from 6 to 7
  3. ✅ Documented known limitations in Summary section
     - LSTM position encoder hardcoded to 2D (only Grid2D works with POMDP)
     - Partial observability not substrate-aware
     - Checkpoint serialization not updated

---

## Current Plan Status

### Strengths ✅

- **Excellent scope discipline:** ZERO Pydantic/schema validation (correctly deferred to TASK-001)
- **Clear phase structure:** 4 phases with 10 bite-sized tasks
- **Proper backward compatibility:** Legacy fallback when no substrate.yaml
- **Comprehensive scope:** Environment, observations, movement, distance, config loading
- **Domain agnostic:** Supports grids, aspatial, and future 3D/hex/graph topologies
- **TDD approach:** Test first, implement, verify, commit
- **Reduced effort:** 6-8 hours (down from 15-22 in first attempt)

### Known Limitations 🔍

1. **LSTM networks not substrate-aware** - AspatialSubstrate only works with SimpleQNetwork
2. **POMDP not substrate-aware** - Partial observability only works with Grid2D
3. **Checkpoints not updated** - Affordance serialization still `[x, y]`

These limitations are **acceptable** for TASK-002A - documented for future work.

### No Critical Gaps 🎯

Review found **ZERO blockers**. All high-priority issues have been addressed.

## Scope Boundaries

### ✅ IN SCOPE (TASK-002A)

- Abstract SpatialSubstrate interface (7 methods)
- Grid2DSubstrate implementation (replicates current behavior)
- AspatialSubstrate implementation (demonstrates concept)
- Environment integration (VectorizedEnv, ObservationBuilder)
- Simple dict-based YAML loading (`yaml.safe_load()` with `.get()`)
- Backward compatibility (legacy mode when no substrate.yaml)
- One example config (L1)

### ❌ OUT OF SCOPE (Deferred to Later Tasks)

- **TASK-001:** Full Pydantic schema validation, DTOs, no-defaults principle
- **TASK-002B:** Action space compatibility, movement deltas from YAML
- **TASK-003:** Universe compilation pipeline, cross-file validation
- Frontend visualization updates (unspecified future work)
- Migration of all config packs (L0, L0.5, L2, L3)
- 3D/hex/graph substrate implementations
- Network architecture substrate awareness (BRAIN_AS_CODE)

## Recommendation to User

**Verdict:** The planning process has successfully produced a **production-ready** implementation plan with proper scope discipline.

**Key Achievements:**

1. ✅ Comprehensive research identifying all hardcoded spatial references
2. ✅ Simplified plan focusing on "exposing the actual system" (user requirement)
3. ✅ Proper scope boundaries - ZERO schema validation (deferred to TASK-001)
4. ✅ Review validation with Grade A scope compliance
5. ✅ All high-priority issues addressed in revision cycle

**Suggested Next Steps:**

### Option 1: Execute Plan (Recommended)

Use `superpowers:subagent-driven-development` to implement task-by-task:

- Dispatch fresh subagent per task
- Code review between tasks (use `superpowers:code-reviewer`)
- Fast iteration with quality gates
- Stays in this session

### Option 2: Execute in Separate Session

Use `superpowers:executing-plans` in clean worktree:

- Batch execution with checkpoints
- Less oversight but faster throughput
- Requires separate git worktree

### Option 3: Manual Implementation

Follow the plan manually:

- 10 bite-sized tasks across 4 phases
- Each task has clear steps and commit messages
- 6-8 hours estimated effort

## Lessons Learned

### ✅ What Worked Well

1. **Staged research → plan → review process** - Caught scope creep before implementation
2. **User feedback during planning** - Corrected course early (Pydantic scope issue)
3. **Review subagent validation** - Identified 3 high-priority issues that would have caused bugs
4. **Iteration cycle** - Addressed all issues before declaring "ready"
5. **Clear scope boundaries** - Explicit deferrals to TASK-001, TASK-002B, TASK-003

### 📝 What Could Be Improved

1. **Initial scope understanding** - First plan included schemas (should have been obvious from TASK-001 name)
2. **Research completeness** - Review found affordance spawn position gap (minor, but catchable)

---

**Status:** ✅ READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION

The plan demonstrates solid software engineering practices, proper scope discipline, and is ready for execution. Estimated implementation time: **6-8 hours**.
