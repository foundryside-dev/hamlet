# **High Level Design: Hamlet v2.0 "Smart Collection" Architecture**

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** November 1, 2025

### 1. 🚀 Executive Summary

This document details the v2.0 architecture for the Hamlet agent, a fundamental refactor from the current v1.0 monolithic system. This new architecture, codenamed the **"Smart Collection,"** migrates the agent from a "model-free" (reactive) paradigm to a "model-based" (predictive) framework.

This v2.0 architecture is explicitly designed to be a **research platform** capable of solving the "moonshot" roadmap goals (Phases 4-8), including Non-Stationarity, Partial Observability (POMDP), Multi-Agent Theory of Mind (ToM), and Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL).

It achieves this by decomposing the agent's "brain" into four specialized, interacting modules:

1. **Module A: Perception Encoder** (Solves POMDP)
2. **Module B: World Model** (Solves Non-Stationarity & Physics)
3. **Module C: Social Model** (Solves Multi-Agent ToM)
4. **Module D: Hierarchical Policy** (Solves HRL & Decision-Making)

These modules communicate via a "universal language" of well-defined data structures (chiefly the `BeliefDistribution`). This design's primary goal is to not only achieve the "moonshot" roadmap but to do so in a **pedagogically transparent** and **debuggable** way, transforming the agent from a "black box" into an interpretable teaching tool.

### 2. 🧠 Core Philosophy & Goals

The "significant tension" between our current v1.0 agent and our v2.0 roadmap goals is the tension between two different types of learning:

- **v1.0 ("The Flashcard Memorizer"):** A brilliant reactive, model-free agent that *memorizes* the value ($Q(s, a)$) of actions in states it has seen. It excels at stable, defined problems.
- **v2.0 ("The Grammar Engine"):** A predictive, model-based agent that learns the *underlying rules ("grammar")* of its world. By learning the "physics" (World Model) and "psychology" (Social Model), it can generate novel, intelligent behavior for situations it has *never* seen.

**Our "Pedagogical First" principle dictates that this v2.0 system must be interpretable.** The core deliverable is not just an agent that *works*, but an agent whose *thought process* can be inspected, debugged, and used for teaching.

### 3. v1.0 Baseline Architecture (For Context)

- **System:** Monolithic, model-free Deep Q-Network (DQN).
- **Policy:** A single network (`RecurrentSpatialQNetwork`) that maps observations directly to Q-values.
- **Strengths:** Excellent for Phase 3.5 (stable, single-agent, full/partial observability).
- **Limitations:** Fundamentally unequipped to handle non-stationarity (Phase 5), complex agent-agent interactions (Phase 4), or hierarchical planning (Phase 7) in a robust or interpretable way.

-----

### 4. v2.0 "Smart Collection" Detailed Architecture

The v2.0 agent is a system of four "expert" modules that collaborate to produce a single, intelligent action.

#### Module A: Perception Encoder (The "Eyes")

- **Roadmap Goal:** Phase 6 (POMDP Extension)
- **Purpose:** To solve partial observability. It answers the question: "What is the *true* state of the world, given my limited 5x5 view?"
- **Architecture:** A recurrent network is essential.
    1. `CNN` processes the 5x5 grid view.
    2. `MLP` processes the vector inputs (self-meters, time).
    3. The concatenated features + `prev_action` are fed into an **LSTM/GRU**.
    4. The output of the LSTM/GRU is passed to two heads to generate the parameters for the `BeliefDistribution` (e.g., `mean` and `log_std` for a Gaussian).
- **Output:** `BeliefDistribution` (see Sec. 5) - the "universal language."

#### Module B: World Model (The "Physics Engine")

- **Roadmap Goal:** Phase 5 (Non-Stationarity & Continuous Learning)
- **Purpose:** To learn the "physics" of the environment. It answers the question: "If I'm in this state and I take this action, what will happen to my meters, position, and reward?"
- **Architecture:** A predictive, feed-forward model.
    1. **Input:** `BeliefDistribution`, `ActionSequence`.
    2. **Core:** An autoregressive "step" model that predicts `t+1` from `t`.
    3. **Heads:** Predicts `next_state`, `next_reward`, `next_done`.
    4. **Refinement:** Includes a **`Value Head`**. This allows the model to be pre-trained to predict not just the next state, but the *value* of that state, aligning it with RL goals from day one.
- **Prerequisite:** This module *must* be trained on a data-driven environment. The hardcoded logic in `vectorized_env.py` (Actions \#1, \#12) must be refactored to be configuration-driven (e.g., YAML) so the World Model can learn these rules.

#### Module C: Social Model (The "Psychology Engine")

- **Roadmap Goal:** Phase 4 (Multi-Agent Competition & Theory of Mind)
- **Purpose:** To learn the "psychology" of other agents. It answers the question: "What does Agent 2 *intend* to do?"
- **Core Challenge:** Solves the "non-predictable complexity" (non-stationarity) of other agents.
- **Our "Detective" Solution:**
    1. **Environment "Cheat" (Cue-Based):** The environment is refactored to generate **`public_cues`** correlated with an agent's hidden state (e.g., `is_slumped`, `is_wearing_work_outfit`).
    2. **Training "Cheat" (CTDE):** The module is trained via **Centralized Training for Decentralized Execution**.
- **Architecture:**
  - **Input:** The `social_cues` component of the `BeliefDistribution`.
  - **Core:** An LSTM/GRU that processes a *history* of an opponent's `(public_cues, action)` pairs.
  - **Output:** `SocialPrediction` (see Sec. 5), a prediction of the opponent's *hidden* `Goal` or `intent`.

#### Module D: Hierarchical Policy (The "CEO")

- **Roadmap Goal:** Phase 7 (Hierarchical RL)

- **Purpose:** To be the agent's "will" or decision-maker. It explicitly separates long-term strategy from short-term tactics.

- **Architecture:** This is explicitly two separate sub-modules.

- **D1: Meta-Controller (The "Strategist")**

  - **Timescale:** Slow (e.g., runs every 50 steps or when a goal is complete).
  - **Inputs:** `BeliefDistribution` (self), `ImaginedFutures` (physics), `SocialPrediction` (others).
  - **Task:** Asks, "What is our *strategic goal* right now?"
  - **Output:** An explicit, interpretable `Goal` struct.

- **D2: Controller (The "Operator")**

  - **Timescale:** Fast (runs every game tick).
  - **Inputs:** `BeliefDistribution`, `ImaginedFutures`, `SocialPrediction`, AND the current `Goal`.
  - **Task:** Asks, "Given our *goal*, what is the single best *primitive action* to take *right now*?"
  - **Output:** A `PrimitiveAction` (e.g., `up`, `down`, `interact`).

### 5. 📦 Key Data Structures (The "Universal Language")

These are the non-negotiable API contracts between modules, defined as Python-style `dataclass` structs.

```python
# The "Universal Language" - Output by Module A
@dataclass
class BeliefDistribution:
    """The full probabilistic belief of the agent about the hidden world state."""
    # Parameters for a Gaussian distribution (e.g., [mean, log_std])
    # This represents the agent's belief over all hidden variables.
    distribution_params: torch.Tensor
    distribution_type: str = "gaussian"

    # Raw data for other modules
    known_state: torch.Tensor      # Ground truth self-data (meters, pos, money)
    social_cues: torch.Tensor      # Raw public cues of other agents
    recurrent_state: Tuple         # The (h, c) of the LSTM for the next tick

# Output by Module B
@dataclass
class ImaginedFuture:
    """A single "dreamt" trajectory from the World Model."""
    action_sequence: list[int]
    predicted_states: list[torch.Tensor]
    predicted_rewards: list[float]
    predicted_dones: list[bool]
    predicted_values: list[float]  # Predicted value of each state
    confidence: float              # How much the WM trusts this "dream"
    uncertainty_reason: Optional[str] = None # e.g., "novel_state", "high_variance"

# Output by Module C
@dataclass
class SocialPrediction:
    """The agent's belief about *another* agent's hidden mind."""
    agent_id: int
    predicted_goal_dist: torch.Tensor # Belief over the opponent's goals
    predicted_next_action_dist: torch.Tensor
    confidence: float              # 0.0-1.0, standardized confidence
    uncertainty_reason: Optional[str] = None # e.g., "conflicting_cues"

# Output by Module D1 (Meta-Controller)
@dataclass
class Goal:
    """An explicit, interpretable, long-term strategic goal."""
    goal_type: str                  # e.g., "SURVIVAL", "THRIVING", "SOCIAL"
    priority: float                 # How important is this goal?
    target_meters: Dict[str, float] # e.g., {"energy": 80, "money": 100}
    termination_condition: Callable # Lambda func to check if goal is met
```

### 6. 🔁 System Data Flow (A Single `agent.think()` Step)

This is the end-to-end operational flow for a single game tick.

1. **SENSE:** `raw_observation_t` and `prev_recurrent_state` enter the system.
2. **PERCEIVE (Module A):** The `PerceptionEncoder` processes this data.
3. **BROADCAST:** Module A outputs the `BeliefDistribution_t`. This is the **single source of truth** for all other modules.
4. **PREDICT (Parallel):**
      - **Module B (World Model)** is called by the Policy (Module D) to "imagine" the outcomes of several candidate action sequences, generating a list of `ImaginedFutures`.
      - **Module C (Social Model)** processes the `BeliefDistribution_t.social_cues` to generate `SocialPrediction_t` for all observed agents.
5. **DECIDE (Module D):**
      - **D1 (Meta-Controller):** Checks if the `current_Goal` is complete (via `termination_condition`). If yes, it uses all inputs (`Belief`, `Futures`, `Social`) to select a new `Goal`.
      - **D2 (Controller):** Uses all inputs and the `current_Goal` to select the single, optimal `PrimitiveAction_t`.
6. **ACT:** The `PrimitiveAction_t` is sent to the environment. The `BeliefDistribution_t.recurrent_state` is saved for the next tick.

### 7. 🛠️ Training & Implementation Strategy

This architecture is complex. We will **not** build it in one "big bang." We will use a two-pronged strategy of Modular Pre-training and Incremental Migration.

#### 7.1 Part 1: Modular Pre-Training (The "Curriculum")

Before any end-to-end RL, each module is pre-trained on a simpler, supervised task to make it "smart" from the start.

| Module | Training Goal | Pre-Training Task | Loss Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **A: Perception** | Learn to see & compress | Autoencoding & Next-Frame Prediction | `Reconstruction Loss + Prediction Loss` |
| **B: World Model** | Learn "physics" & "value" | Supervised Consequence Prediction | `MSE(pred_state, real_state) + MSE(pred_reward, real_reward) + MSE(pred_value, real_value)` |
| **C: Social Model** | Learn "psychology" | CTDE "Telepathic" Cheat | `MSE(pred_opponent_goal, real_opponent_goal)` |
| **D: Policy** | Learn "common sense" | Behavioral Cloning (from v1.0 agent) | `CrossEntropyLoss(policy_action, expert_action)` |

#### 7.2 Part 2: Incremental Migration (The "Scaffolding")

This is the engineering migration path to de-risk the refactor.

- **Phase 1: Foundation (Prerequisites)**

  - Implement the explicit data structures (Sec. 5).
  - Refactor the environment for `public_cues` (for Module C).
  - Refactor environment "physics" (Actions \#1, \#12) to be data-driven (for Module B).

- **Phase 2: v1.5 (Perception Test)**

  - **Architecture:** `Module A (Perception)` + v1.0 `Q-Network`.
  - **Logic:** The Q-Network's input is replaced. Instead of `raw_observation`, it now takes the `BeliefDistribution.distribution_params`.
  - **Goal:** Validate that `Module A` can solve the POMDP task and is a viable replacement.

- **Phase 3: v1.7 (Planning Test)**

  - **Architecture:** `v1.5` + `Module B (World Model)`.
  - **Logic:** Use the `ImaginedFutures` from the pre-trained World Model to enhance the Q-learning update (e.g., Dyna-style multi-step rollouts).
  - **Goal:** Validate that `Module B` can accelerate learning and adapt to non-stationarity.

- **Phase 4: v2.0 (Full System Integration)**

  - **Architecture:** All pre-trained modules are integrated.
  - **Logic:** The v1.0 `Q-Network` is fully *removed* and *replaced* by the pre-trained `Module D (Hierarchical Policy)`.
  - **Goal:** The full "Smart Collection" is now active and ready for final, end-to-end fine-tuning with RL.

### 8. 🎓 Pedagogical Payoff & UI Strategy

This architecture's primary benefit—beyond performance—is **interpretability**. This is how we achieve our "Pedagogical First" goal.

#### 8.1 The Debugging Workflow (The "Payoff")

This is the "product" of the v2.0 architecture: a fully transparent, debuggable "mind."

**Example Debugging Scenario:** "The agent is starving but is standing at the 'job' affordance. Why?"

```python
def debug_agent_failure(trace):

    # 1. Is it 'blind'?
    if trace.belief_state.uncertainty['my_meters'] > 0.9:
        print("DIAGNOSIS: PERCEPTION (A) FAILURE.")
        print("Agent is 'confused' and doesn't know its own meters are low.")

    # 2. Is it 'delusional' about physics?
    elif trace.imagined_futures['fridge_path'].reward < 0:
        print("DIAGNOSIS: WORLD MODEL (B) FAILURE.")
        print("Agent 'believes' the fridge has a negative reward. Its 'physics' is wrong.")

    # 3. Is it 'scared' or 'polite'?
    elif trace.social_prediction['agent_2'].predicted_goal == 'use_fridge':
        print("DIAGNOSIS: SOCIAL MODEL (C) INTERFERENCE.")
        print("Agent 'thinks' Agent 2 is going to the fridge, so it 'yielded'.")

    # 4. Is it just 'obsessed'?
    elif trace.policy_goal.goal_type == 'THRIVING' and trace.policy_goal.priority > 0.9:
        print("DIAGNOSIS: POLICY (D) FAILURE.")
        print("Agent 'knows' it's starving, but its 'Meta-Controller' has decided 'money' is more important.")
```

#### 8.2 Pedagogical Lab Curriculum

This architecture enables a new curriculum based on debugging the agent's "mind."

- **Lab 1: Perception Failures:** "Agent keeps bumping into walls. Examine the `BeliefDistribution`'s uncertainty. Why is it 'lost'?"
- **Lab 2: World Model Limitations:** "Agent tries to use the 'job' affordance at 3 AM. Analyze its `ImaginedFuture` for this action. What did it *think* would happen?"
- **Lab 3: Social Misunderstandings:** "Agent avoids an empty bed. Analyze the `SocialPrediction`. Which *public cue* from Agent 2 did it misinterpret?"
- **Lab 4: Goal Conflicts:** "Agent starves while having high 'money'. Debug the `Meta-Controller`'s `Goal` selection logic. Is its 'priority' wrong?"

#### 8.3 Progressive Complexity UI

To mitigate cognitive overload for students, the demo UI will be configurable to reveal modules progressively.

```python
# UI config to progressively enable module visualizations
AGENT_COMPLEXITY_LEVELS = {
    'beginner': ['policy'], # Show "Agent chose to 'go to job'"
    'intermediate': ['perception', 'policy'], # Show "Agent *believes* its energy is 50, so it chose 'go to bed'"
    'advanced': ['perception', 'world_model', 'policy'], # Show "Agent *imagined* the job would give +$20..."
    'research': ['perception', 'world_model', 'social_model', 'policy'] # Show full trace
}
```

### 9. ⚠️ Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Training Complexity** | **Modular Pre-training.** We solve 4 simple problems, not 1 complex one. |
| **Computational Overhead** | **Selective Imagination.** Module D only asks Module B to "imagine" a few high-priority candidate paths, not all of them. |
| **Belief Divergence** | **Observation Correction.** The `BeliefDistribution` is corrected by new `raw_observations` on every tick, preventing it from "dreaming" forever. |
| **Cognitive Overload (for Student)** | **Progressive UI (Sec 8.3).** The UI will match the student's learning, from "beginner" to "research" mode. |

### 10. 📊 Success Metrics

### 11. 🔬 Future Research Projects Enabled

This architecture is not an endpoint; it's a platform. It unlocks numerous research avenues:

- "Extending the World Model to handle *novel* affordances without re-training."
- "Improving the Social Model's inference capabilities with more complex 'cues'."
- "Investigating emergent `Goal` selection strategies in the Meta-Controller."
- "Adding an explicit communication channel for Phase 8, using the `SocialPrediction` as a foundation."

Master Design Document: Appendix A (v1.1)

Appendix A: The "Personality & Family" Layer (v2.1 / v3.0 Extension)

Document Version: 1.1 Date: November 1, 2025 Status: PROPOSED EXTENSION

A.1 Purpose

This appendix details a proposed "Personality & Family" layer. This system introduces Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning to the platform by modeling innate agent personality and genetic relationships.

This enables the simulation of complex social structures (e.g., families) by replacing random agent generation with a heritable system.

v1.1 Update: This design now includes a private, "in-group" communication channel for family members. This provides a direct mechanism for Phase 8 (Emergent Communication), where agents can learn to negotiate and use this channel for complex, cooperative strategies (e.g., "sharing," "resource warning," "coordinated action").

A.2 The "API Contract": The AgentDNA Struct

The AgentDNA is defined at agent creation. It defines the agent's "personality" and social connections.
Python

import torch
from typing import Tuple, Dict

@dataclass
class AgentDNA:
    """
    Defines the innate, heritable "personality" and
    social group of an agent.
    """

    # --- Genetic Algorithm Traits (The "Knobs") ---
    neuroticism: float  # High = high risk-aversion
    greed: float        # High = high 'money' goal priority
    agreeableness: float# High = high 'social' goal priority
    curiosity: float    # High = high 'exploration' goal priority

    # --- Genetic Metadata ---
    generation: int
    parent_ids: Tuple[Optional[int], Optional[int]]

    # --- NEW: Family & Communication ID ---
    family_id: int      # The int64 "key" to the private comms channel

    def as_tensor(self) -> torch.Tensor:
        """
        Converts traits into a fixed-shape tensor for the Policy.
        SHAPE: [1, 4]
        """
        return torch.tensor([[
            self.neuroticism,
            self.greed,
            self.agreeableness,
            self.curiosity
        ]])

A.3 Architectural Integration (The "Plug-ins")

This system plugs into the v2.0 architecture in three places:

    Personality (Input to D1): The AgentDNA.as_tensor() is concatenated to the Meta-Controller (Module D1), biasing its strategic Goal selection as described in the Master Design.

    Communication (Input to Environment): The agent's Controller (Module D2) is given a new action: SetCommChannel(int64). This action writes its chosen int64 value to a "family bulletin board" in the environment.

    Communication (Input to A): The Environment reads this "bulletin board" and adds it to the RawObservation for all other family members.

A.4 The "Firewall" & Communication Channel

This system requires a minor update to our "Firewall" (Sec 4 in the Master Design). The RawObservation object is updated.
Python

# The "Fog of War" View (What the Agent Receives)

@dataclass
class RawObservation:

    my_known_state: torch.Tensor
    # SHAPE: [B, K_MAX]

    visible_grid: torch.Tensor
    # SHAPE: [B, 5, 5]

    visible_agent_cues: torch.Tensor
    # SHAPE: [B, N_AGENTS_MAX - 1, C_MAX]

    # --- NEW: Family Communication ---
    family_comm_channel: torch.Tensor
    # SHAPE: [B, N_AGENTS_MAX - 1] (as int64)
    #
    # This is an array of the int64 values being "broadcast" by
    # every *other* agent that shares my 'family_id'.
    # It is ZERO for all non-family agents.
    # The agent's 'Social Model' (Module C) must learn to
    # "negotiate the meaning" of these integers.

A.5 The "Three-Loop" Learning System

This update does not change the "Three-Loop" system.

    Inner Loop (RL): Learns the policy. Now also learns how to use the int64 channel to maximize reward.

    Middle Loop (Adaptation): "Near death" experiences tweak AgentDNA.neuroticism.

    Outer Loop (GA): The Population Manager uses GA to evolve the AgentDNA (personality traits and family_id groupings).

A.6 New Subsystems Enabled

This "Personality Layer" is the enabling system for high-level social dynamics.

    Family Generation: A "family" (e.g., two parents, one child) is generated by the Population Manager GA. They are spawned with a shared, unique family_id.

    Evolved Personalities: We can evolve populations with different Fitness_Functions (e.g., "capitalists" vs. "survivors").

    Emergent Communication (The int64 Channel): This is the most powerful new feature.

        Agents have a new action: SetCommChannel(int64).

        Module C (Social Model) now has a new input: the family_comm_channel. It will learn that this channel is highly predictive of in-group behavior.

        Module D (Policy) will learn to set this channel to influence its family.

        Example: An agent at the "job" affordance sees its money rise. It learns to SetCommChannel(123). Its "child" agent, miles away, observes family_comm_channel = [..., 123, ...]. The "child's" Social Model learns that "123" correlates with its "parent's" money increasing, and its Policy (Module D) learns that moving toward the parent (who is at the "job") is a good idea.

        The agents have, without any hardcoding, "negotiated a meaning" for the integer 123: "I have found a good source of money."

==============

CHATGPT Review:

# Short confirmation (TL;DR)

No-code configs + bar-only affordances = simpler, better inductive biases for DRL and emergent behaviour. You’ll get more stable training and clearer supervision data for Module B/C.
Confidence: **very likely (~85%)**

## Important consequences (you already know most of these, but worth stating)

1. **All affordance outcomes must be expressible as bar deltas over one or many ticks.** That’s fine — everything you described (beds, fridges, bars, phones as payments/teleports) fits.
   WEP: **very likely (~90%)**

2. **Any truly special effect (teleport, kill, spawn) is implemented *in the engine* as a small, repeatable effect handler; configs only reference it by name.** That keeps the YAML pure while allowing controlled exceptions.
   WEP: **very likely (~90%)**

3. **No global ownership state reduces engineering complexity and avoids persistent-entity bookkeeping.** But you need clear per-tick semantics to avoid races (see below).
   WEP: **very likely (~85%)**

---

## Practical spec additions (keeps YAML code-free but engine-ready)

Add these optional but recommended fields to `affordances.yaml`. They are metadata only — still no logic in YAML.

```yaml
- id: "bed"
  quality: 1.0                   # multiplier for restful effect (>1 = better)
  capacity: 1                    # number of agents that can occupy simultaneously
  exclusive: true                # whether simultaneous use is allowed
  interaction_type: "multi_tick"
  interruptible: true            # can be cancelled by moving, attack, etc
  precondition:
    - { bar: "money", op: ">=", val: 0 }  # still declarative only
  distance_limit: 1              # max tiles away to engage (optional)
  costs:
    - { bar: "money", change: -5 }
  effects_per_tick:
    - { bar: "energy", change: +25, scale_by: "quality" }
  completion_bonus:
    - { bar: "energy", change: +25 }
```

Why these fields:

- `quality` lets you have many beds without hardcoding effects; better beds = larger scale.
- `capacity` + `exclusive` allow multiple beds in same tile or bunkbeds without a global owner.
- `interruptible` prevents agents from being trapped in interactions (important for emergent behaviours).
- `distance_limit` supports affordances like phones/teleporters being usable from nearby tiles without special-case logic.

WEP: **likely (~75%)** these fields cover 90% of use-cases without code changes.

---

## Engine semantics you must define (deterministic, simple rules)

1. **Reservation vs. Use**

   - *Reservation phase*: when agent begins interaction, engine checks capacity & preconditions; if accepted, it creates a **local reservation token** tied to that agent only for the duration. Reservation is ephemeral and only lives in tick context (not persisted to config). No global persistent ownership.
2. **Capacity & contention resolution**

   - If multiple agents attempt to reserve and capacity is exceeded in the same tick, resolve deterministically: sort agents by `(priority, agent_id)` where `priority` is e.g. distance, hunger, or a fixed tie-breaker (or random seeded). Use seed so replays deterministic.
3. **Atomic per-tick effect application**

   - Collect all accepted affordance effects (including per-tick effects). Sum deltas per bar, then apply atomically. Clamp to min/max afterwards. This preserves your no-global-state goal and avoids partial application weirdness.
4. **Interrupts**

   - If `interruptible: true` and agent moves or receives an effect that should break (health→0, death), engine aborts multi-tick and applies partial completion semantics defined by `on_interrupt` (configurable: refund fraction, no bonus, partial penalty). Keep `on_interrupt` declarative.
5. **Implicit local state**

   - Allow affordances to carry **ephemeral local interaction state** only (e.g., `interaction_progress` keyed by agent id) stored in the tick context or agent’s own state. Do not persist affordance occupancy beyond the tick unless it is a reservation token. This respects your "owned only while on it" rule.
6. **Special effects whitelist**

   - Allow `effect_type: teleport` in YAML, but require engine to implement the handler. Keep the effect set small and versioned. If you add a special effect (eg. `kill_target`) implement it once in engine and then any affordance can reference it.

WEP: **very likely (~85%)** these rules prevent race conditions and keep world stateless.

---

## Examples for phone/ambulance, still config-only semantics

```yaml
- id: "phone_ambulance"
  interaction_type: "instant"
  costs:
    - { bar: "money", change: -300 }
  effects:
    - { effect_type: "teleport", destination_tag: "nearest_hospital", precondition: {bar: "health", op: "<=", val: 20} }
```

Engine behaviour: the YAML declares `teleport` with a `destination_tag` (no coordinates in configs). The engine resolves `nearest_hospital` at runtime (engine code) and applies teleport. No code appears in YAML; special logic confined to deterministic engine handler.

WEP: **likely (~70%)** this pattern balances purity and practical needs.

## Contention & emergent behaviour examples

- Multiple beds: two agents try to sleep in same tile; capacity=1 ⇒ engine resolves reservation deterministically and the losing agent can choose alternate affordance or queue (queueing implemented in agent, not engine). This spawns interesting emergent choices: do I wait, steal someone’s bed, or choose a poorer bed? Exactly what you want.

- Phone ambulance decisions: agent near death chooses between running to hospital affordance on map vs using a phone affordance that costs money but teleports. The decision emerges purely from bars (health, money, distance/time-to-hospital). No flashy code required.

WEP: **very likely (~85%)** you'll see rich trade-offs with these simple rules.

### Small additions to `cues.yaml` to keep it minimal but expressive

Add `salience`/`decay` maybe:

```yaml
- cue_id: "looks_tired"
  conditions:
    - { bar: "energy", op: "<", val: 20 }
  salience: 0.8    # how strongly this cue should influence social inference
  decay_ticks: 3   # how long cue persists in public perception
```

Engine note: `decay_ticks` is ephemeral: the cue existence is derived each tick from current bars, but `decay_ticks` helps model simulated perception lag or misattribution and is implemented in runtime perception (not in config logic).

WEP: **plausible (~60%)** this adds nuance for ToM training without polluting configs with code.

## Tests & CI you should add for this no-code constraint

1. **Affordance purity test** — assert every affordance `effects` contains only bar changes or a named `effect_type` from the engine whitelist. Fail CI if a new anonymous effect appears.
2. **Reservation determinism test** — simulate many agents trying to reserve same affordance on seeded RNG; assert deterministic outcome across runs.
3. **Interrupt semantics test** — start multi-tick affordance, interrupt, assert `on_interrupt` behaviour matches YAML-declared expectation.
4. **No persistent ownership test** — after agent leaves affordance, assert affordance has no leftover state.

WEP: **very likely (~85%)** these prevent drift from design.

## Short checklist to paste into your sprint ticket

- [ ] Add optional fields to `affordances.yaml`: `capacity`, `exclusive`, `quality`, `interruptible`, `distance_limit`, `on_interrupt`.
- [ ] Implement engine reservation token system (ephemeral, per-tick).
- [ ] Implement deterministic contention tie-breaker (seeded).
- [ ] Add `effect_type` whitelist and engine handlers for `teleport` and any future specials.
- [ ] Add CI check: `affordances` must only reference bar-changes or official `effect_type` tokens.
- [ ] Add unit tests: reservation, atomic application, interrupt, teleport resolution.
- [ ] Log reservations and outcome to trace for Module B/C training.
