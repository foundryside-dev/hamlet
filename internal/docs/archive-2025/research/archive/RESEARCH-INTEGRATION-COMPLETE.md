## Task Documents Updated

### TASK-002: UAC Contracts (+8-12h effort)

**Updates Applied**:

- ✅ Added 400+ lines of capability system documentation
- ✅ Defined 6 core capabilities with Pydantic DTOs
- ✅ Added effect pipeline system
- ✅ Added affordance masking (availability, modes)
- ✅ Added backward compatibility strategy
- ✅ Added navigation aids and quick reference table (Phase 3 improvement)
- ✅ Updated effort: 7-12h → 15-24h

**Key Additions**:

- `BarConstraint` DTO for meter-based availability
- `ModeConfig` DTO for operating hours
- 6 capability DTOs (MultiTick, Cooldown, MeterGated, SkillScaling, Probabilistic, Prerequisite)
- `EffectPipeline` DTO with lifecycle stages

---

### TASK-003: UAC Action Space (+3-4h effort)

**Updates Applied**:

- ✅ Added `ActionCost` DTO for multi-meter costs
- ✅ Replaced `energy_cost` with `costs: list[ActionCost]`
- ✅ Added backward compatibility for legacy configs
- ✅ Documented pattern consistency with affordances
- ✅ Updated effort: 8-13h → 11-17h

**Key Pattern**:

- Actions now use `costs: [{meter, amount}]` matching affordances
- Supports multi-meter depletion (energy + hygiene + satiation)
- Supports restoration (negative amounts for REST action)

---

### TASK-004: Universe Compiler (+6-8h effort)

**Updates Applied**:

- ✅ Added capability meter reference validation
- ✅ Added effect pipeline consistency validation
- ✅ Added availability constraint validation
- ✅ Added action cost meter reference validation
- ✅ Added capability conflict validation
- ✅ Updated effort: 40-58h → 46-66h

**Validation Rules Added**:

- Meter references in capabilities must exist
- Mutually exclusive capabilities (instant + multi_tick)
- Dependent capabilities (resumable requires multi_tick)
- Effect pipeline consistency

---

### TASK-005: BRAIN_AS_CODE (+0h, deferred)

**Updates Applied**:

- ✅ Added "Optional Future Extension: RND Architecture" section
- ✅ Documented deferral rationale
- ✅ Provided implementation notes if requested
- ✅ Estimated effort: +1-2h (only if implemented)

**Rationale**: RND is implementation detail with low pedagogical value

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well

1. ✅ **Systematic 3-phase approach** prevented gaps in integration
2. ✅ **Integration matrix** (Phase 1) captured all 34 points accurately
3. ✅ **Pattern consistency** maintaining `{meter, amount}` simplified design
4. ✅ **Phased breakdown** makes TASK-002 scope manageable
5. ✅ **Clear deferral rationale** (Gap 3 RND) prevents scope creep

### Challenges

1. ⚠️ **TASK-002 scope expansion** (+114-200%) is significant
   - Mitigation: Split into TASK-002A (core) and TASK-002B (capabilities)
2. ⚠️ **Cross-task coordination** (Gap 2 spans TASK-003 and TASK-004)
   - Mitigation: Clear implementation order (schema first, then validation)

### Process Improvements

1. ✅ **Phase 3 review** caught 3 minor issues before implementation
2. ✅ **Navigation aids** improve usability of dense documentation
3. ✅ **Integration status markers** make research retirement clear
