## Problem Statement

### Current Constraint

**Example** (code/config showing the limitation):

```python
# Current problematic code
```

### Why This Is Technical Debt, Not Design

**Test**: "If removed, would the system be more expressive or more fragile?"

**Answer**: [More expressive / More fragile]
