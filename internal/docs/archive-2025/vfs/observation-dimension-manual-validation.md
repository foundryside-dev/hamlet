# Manual Observation Dimension Validation

**Purpose**: Manually calculate expected observation dimensions for each config to validate against VFS implementation (Cycle 5).

**Date**: 2025-11-07
**Cycle**: 0.3 (Observation Structure Reverse Engineering)

---

## Calculation Method

For each config, calculate:
```
Total = substrate_dim + meter_count + affordance_dims + temporal_dims
```

Where:
- **substrate_dim**: From substrate.get_observation_dim()
  - Full observability: grid_cells + position_dims
  - POMDP: window_size^position_dim (no grid encoding in POMDP)
- **meter_count**: Always 8 (energy, health, satiation, money, mood, social, fitness, hygiene)
- **affordance_dims**: Always 15 (14 affordances + "none" one-hot)
- **temporal_dims**: Always 4 (time_sin, time_cos, interaction_progress, lifetime_progress)

## Key Insights

### Insight 1: Grid Size Affects Dimensions (Full Observability)
Full observability configs have different dimensions based on grid size:
- 3×3 grid → 38 dims
- 7×7 grid → 78 dims
- 8×8 grid → 93 dims

**Implication**: Checkpoint transfer only possible between configs with same grid size (e.g., L1 ↔ L3).

### Insight 2: POMDP Uses Local Window, Not Full Grid
POMDP observation includes:
- **Local window**: 25 cells (5×5 window around agent)
- **Position**: 2 dims (normalized, for spatial context)
- NOT the full 64-cell grid

**Implication**: POMDP dimensions (54) much smaller than full observability (93) despite same grid size.

### Insight 3: Temporal Mechanics Don't Change Dimensions
L3 has same dimensions as L1 (both 93) because:
- Temporal features (time_sin, time_cos) are ALWAYS present in all configs
- Operating hours and multi-tick interactions are runtime behavior, not observation changes

## Critical Validation Points for Cycle 5

When implementing VFS (Cycles 1-3) and testing regression (Cycle 5), ensure:

1. **VFS dimension calculation matches these manual calculations**
   ```python
   vfs_dim = sum(field.shape_size for field in obs_spec.fields)
   assert vfs_dim == expected_dim  # Must match!
   ```

2. **Variable shape inference correct**
   - vecNf with dims=N → contributes N to observation_dim
   - scalar → contributes 1 to observation_dim

3. **Substrate encoding handled correctly**
   - Full observability: grid_cells + position_dims
   - POMDP: window_cells (no full grid) + position_dims

4. **All configs tested**
   - Regression tests MUST cover all 5 configs
   - Any mismatch breaks checkpoint compatibility
