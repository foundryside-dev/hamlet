"""Temporal mechanics utilities.

Canonical implementation of time-based logic for affordance operating hours.
This module provides the single source of truth for temporal semantics.

IMPORTANT: All time-based logic MUST use these functions. Do not re-implement
operating hours logic elsewhere - it creates drift and bugs (see JANK-09).
"""


def is_affordance_open(time_of_day: int, operating_hours: tuple[int, int]) -> bool:
    """Check if affordance is open at given time (CANONICAL IMPLEMENTATION).

    This is the single source of truth for time window logic. The operating_hours
    parameter is a runtime tuple format (open_hour, close_hour), distinct from the
    YAML config format which uses structured opening_hours with schedules.
    All other implementations (AffordanceEngine, compiler, env) must delegate to this.

    Supports three notations:
    - Normal hours: [8, 18] = 8am to 6pm (open_hour < close_hour)
    - Wraparound (modulo): [18, 28] = 6pm to 4am (close_hour > 24)
    - Wraparound (negative): [22, 6] = 10pm to 6am (open_hour > close_hour)
    - 24/7: [0, 24] or any interval spanning 24 hours

    Examples:
        >>> is_affordance_open(12, (8, 18))  # Noon, normal hours
        True
        >>> is_affordance_open(20, (18, 28))  # 8pm, bar open 6pm-4am
        True
        >>> is_affordance_open(2, (18, 28))   # 2am, bar still open
        True
        >>> is_affordance_open(23, (22, 6))   # 11pm, late night
        True
        >>> is_affordance_open(1, (22, 6))    # 1am, late night
        True
        >>> is_affordance_open(12, (0, 24))   # 24/7 operation
        True

    Args:
        time_of_day: Current hour [0-23]
        operating_hours: Tuple of (open_hour, close_hour)

    Returns:
        True if affordance is open, False if closed

    Implementation notes:
        - Uses modulo arithmetic to handle all wraparound cases uniformly
        - Detects 24/7 operation: (close - open) % 24 == 0
        - Normalizes all hours to [0-23] range before comparison
        - Handles both [18, 28] and [22, 6] notations correctly

    History:
        - 2025-11-14: Extracted from UniverseCompiler._is_open() to fix JANK-09
        - Previously had 3 implementations with inconsistencies:
          * affordance_config.is_affordance_open() - failed on [18, 28]
          * AffordanceEngine.is_affordance_open() - failed on [22, 6]
          * UniverseCompiler._is_open() - correct (became this function)
