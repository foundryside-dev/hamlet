    A spatial substrate defines:
    - How positions are represented (dimensionality, dtype)
    - How positions are initialized (random, fixed, etc.)
    - How movement is applied (deltas, boundaries)
    - How distance is computed (Manhattan, Euclidean, graph distance)
    - How positions are encoded in observations

    Key insight: The substrate is OPTIONAL. Aspatial universes (pure state
    machines without positioning) are valid and reveal that meters (bars)
    are the true universe.

    Design Principles:
    - Conceptual Agnosticism: Don't assume 2D, Euclidean, or grid-based
    - Permissive Semantics: Allow 3D, hexagonal, continuous, graph, aspatial
    - Structural Enforcement: Validate tensor shapes, boundary behaviors
