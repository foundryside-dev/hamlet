"""Integration test for RND loss tracking and TensorBoard logging.

This test verifies that when using RND exploration, the predictor loss is
tracked and available for monitoring (similar to Q-network loss tracking).

Bug discovered during mypy fixes: RND loss was computed but immediately
discarded without being tracked or logged.
